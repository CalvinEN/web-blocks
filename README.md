Web Blocks
==========

A WebGL application for building worlds and learning programming. Inspired by Minecraft Pi Edition.

See it in action here: [http://wb.buz.co/]

Controls
--------

Move forwards / backwards: W and S

Move sideways: A and D

Look around: Arrow keys

Code editor: Escape key

Notes
-----

This app will only work on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and on computers with 3D graphics chips. This is only a demo at the moment so there will be bugs. I hope to eventually grow it into a useful education tool. Help is always welcome.

Includes experiment support for Google Cardboard!
